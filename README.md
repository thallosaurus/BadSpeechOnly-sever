# BadSpeechOnline-server

This repository contains all files needed to run your own server for Bad Speech Online. It runs mainly on node.js and socket.io (and express for some small things like http serving for demo files and testing tools).

## How do I run this server?
First, clone the git repo. After that, click on "start.bat". The bootstrapper automatically pulls the newest files from this repo to ensure that you always have the newest files. To skip this, run "node app.js [port] production" in your server directory (the directory, you initially cloned this repo), although I really recommend using the bootstrapper since this is alpha software which isn't finished yet (and it's far from finished). It's not assembler code which can fry your PC, but you get the concept.
